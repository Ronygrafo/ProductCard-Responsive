## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Pure CSS - custom properties
- Flexbox
- Liking componentes with **Fontawesome** and **Google Fonts** resources

### What I learned

I learned how to use Media Querys for device screen size indicated on the style-guide

```css
/* MEDIA QUERY MOBILE */
@media (max-width: 600px){
}
```

### Continued development

I will continue with media Querys for different sizes and some animations, I want to master CSS

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This always helps me to recap knowledge with Flexbox.
- [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - Always a helpful guide for tags, attributes, properties, snippets... This is my manual
